### NLP Project 2 example program

Collection of fuctions that perform basic NLP probabilistic tasks on a given corpus

The corpora the program is currently hardcoded to use come from https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/

To change the corpus, edit the first few lines of main.py with the correct filename and make sure the file is in the same directory as which the command is run from.
